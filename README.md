# ClassConnect 🚧 *(Work in Progress)*

ClassConnect is a real-time attendance tracking web application designed for classrooms and lecture halls. It allows professors to generate dynamic QR codes that students scan to mark their attendance. These QR codes refresh periodically, preventing spoofing via screenshots or repeat submissions. The backend verifies and stores each student's data securely in a cloud-based database, while professors can monitor attendance records through a dashboard.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently under development. Features are being actively built and improved.
